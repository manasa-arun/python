## `reverse()` function in python:
The `reverse()` function is a one of the built-in functions in python.
The `reverse()` is used for `Returns a reverse iterator`.

## `reverse()` function syntax
```python
reverse(sequence_object)
```
## `reverse()` function parameter
it takes a single parameter
sequence_object - an indexable object to be reversed (can be a tuple, string, list, range, etc.)












Note: Since we can't index objects such as a set and a dictionary, they are not considered sequence objects.
