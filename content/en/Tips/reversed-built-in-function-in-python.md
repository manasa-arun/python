## reverse() function in python:
The `reverse()` function is a one of the built-in functions in python.
`reverse()` is used for `Returns a reverse iterator`.

# syntax:
```
reverse(sequence_object)
```
it takes a single parameter

where,
sequence_object - an indexable object to be reversed (can be a tuple, string, list, range, etc.)












Note: Since we can't index objects such as a set and a dictionary, they are not considered sequence objects.
