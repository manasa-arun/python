## `variable naming rules` or `Declare a variable ` in Python

when declaring a variables we must follow these variable naming rules:

1.we can not use Python's key words as a variable name.
## Example:
  class,continue,lambda Python have more number of keywords
  these names are not allowed to use as variable name

2.A variable name cannot contain spaces
## Example:
  Studentname is correct format
  Student name is not correct(spaces are not allowed in variable name)


3.The first character must be one of the letters of the alphabet or an underscore(_).

## Example:
  _num is correct format
  #num is not correct format(first letter should be _ or any letter in alphabets)
  num is correct format
  3num is not correct (should not begin with number)
  
4.After the first character we may use the any letter or digit or underscore.
## Example:
  my_num is correct
  num1 is correct 
  1num is not correct(first letter of variable does't contain digit)

5.Uppercase and lowercase characters are distinct.
## Example:
  variable name `CollegeName` is not same as `collegename` 
  age is not same as Age
  X is not same as x

## Example:
```
x = 30
y = "aaa"
print(x)
print(y)
```
## output:
```
30
aaa
```
in this Example x and y are variables.
