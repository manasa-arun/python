## list():
The `list()` function is one of the built-in function in python.
`list()` is used for `Returns a list`.

Lists are created using square brackets

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data of (Tuple, Set, and Dictionary)

# syntax:
```
list_name = [items]
```
where, items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

# Example:
```
my_list = ["pythonshiksha",29,'s',-7.5,3.9]
print(my_list)
```
output:
```
['pythonshiksha', 29, 's', -7.5, 3.9]
```
like this e can store multiple data types in one variable.

# Example:
```
fruits_list = ["apple","banana","pomegranate","guava","grapes","banana"]
print(fruits_list)
```
output:
```
['apple', 'banana', 'pomegranate', 'guava', 'grapes', 'banana']
```
