## `hasattr()` function in Python

###  `hasattr()` Function Examples:

let's go through couple of examples to understand `hasattr()` function in Python

### Example 1:

```Python
class employee:
    age = 45
    name = "ccc"

employee = employee()

print("employee's name:", hasattr(employee, "name"))
print("employee's salary:", hasattr(employee, "salary"))
```
output:

```Python
employee's name: True
employee's salary: False
```
employee name is exists so it is True.
employee salary is not exists so it is False.


### Example 2:

```Python
class family:
    father = "fff"
    mother = "mmm"
    brother = "bbb"
    sister = "sss"

family = family()

print("The family class has father:", hasattr(family, "father"))
print("The family class has mother: ", hasattr(family, "mother"))
print("The family class has brother:", hasattr(family, "brother"))
print("The family class has sister: ", hasattr(family, "sister"))
print("The family class has elder brother:", hasattr(family, "elder brother"))
```

output:

```Python
The family class has father: True
The family class has mother:  True
The family class has brother: True
The family class has sister:  True
The family class has elder brother: False
```
This family do'nt have a elder brother so it is false remaining all are true.
