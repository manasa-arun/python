## `open()` function in Python

1. The `open()` function is a one of the built-in functions in Python.
2. The `open()` is used for `Opens a file and returns a file object`.

## `open()` function Syntax

```Python
open(file, mode)
```
## `open()` function parameters

`open()` function can take two parameters.
1. file 	The path and name of the file
2. mode 	A string, define which mode you want to open the file in:


"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist

"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exist

"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist

In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode

"t" - Text - Default value. Text mode

"b" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)

### `open()` function Examples:

let's go through some of examples to understand `open()` function in Python

### Example 1: This codes can help us to open, write, read or append a program 

```Python
# opens the file in reading mode
f = open("path_to_file", mode='r')

# opens the file in writing mode 
f = open("path_to_file", mode = 'w')

# opens for writing to the end 
f = open("path_to_file", mode = 'a')
```

## Example 2:

```Python
f = open("demo.py", "r")

print(f.read())
```

output:

```Python
print("welcome to best tutorial")
print("Python shiksha")
```

here first i created a demo.py file to read a file

`demo.py` file is here
```Python
print("welcome to best tutorial")
print("Python shiksha")
```
when we call as open `demo.py` in the output the entire program can display like this try it now.
