## Python `False` keyword 

1. The `false` keyword is one of the keyword out of thirty-five keywords in Python.
2. The result of a comparison operation is the Boolean value `False`.
3. The `False` keyword is equivalent to 0. 
4. Boolean values are often used in conditional statements to control the flow of a program

## Python `false` keyword Uses

1. In Python, the `False` keyword is a Boolean value that represents the logical value "false". 
2. It is one of the two possible values of the Boolean data type, along with the True keyword.

## Python `False` keyword Examples:

let's go through some of examples to understand `False` keyword in Python

### Example 1:
checking the statements

```Python
print(4>6)
print(5==8)
print(10>20)
```
output:

```Python
False
False
False
```

### Example 2:   
comparing the statements either `True` or `False`

```Python
a = 25
b = 40

print(a+b >=50)
print(a>=20 and b>=40)
print(a==10 and b==20) #b is not correct so it is false
print(a!=20 and b!=10)
print(a>30 and b>35) # a is not correct so it is false
```
output

```Python
True
True
False
True
False
```
In this above program `a and b` are compared and the condition is satisfied then it will give output as `True` or else after comparing  condition is not satisfied then it will give output as `False`.

you'll see these keywords written in lowercase ( true and false ), but in Python they are always written in uppercase. (True and False)

## Summary
In this tutorial we learnt about Python `false` keyword usage with the help of simple examples.
