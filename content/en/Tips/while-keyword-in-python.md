## introduction to keywords:

Keywords are python reserved words.
We cannot use them as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
we have Thirty-five keywords in python.

## list of the Python keywords:

False               class               from                or
None                continue            global              pass
True                def                 if                  raise
and                 del                 import              return
as                  elif                in                  try
assert              else                is                  while
async               except              lambda              with
await               finally             nonlocal            yield
break               for                 not  

## `while` keyword in python

1. The`while` keyword is one of the keyword out of thirty-five keywords in python.

2. The `While` condition is true, a series of statements can be run in a while loop, The loop iterates while the condition is true.
When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.

3. In Python, a block of code consists of all the statements that follow a programming construct and are indented by the same number of character spaces. 

## Syntax of `while`  keyword

```python
while condition:
    statements   #indent is compulsory
```

### `while()` keyword Examples:

let's go through some of examples to understand `while()` keyword in python.

### Example 1:

```python
i = 0
while i < 4:
  print(i)
  i += 1
```
output:
```python
1
2
3
```
In this example i is 0 and less than four so after iteration with while loop only three numbers can get like this.

### Example 2:

```python
i=2
while i<5:
        print("pythonshiksha")
        i=i+1
        
```
output:

```python
pythonshiksha
pythonshiksha
pythonshiksha

```
