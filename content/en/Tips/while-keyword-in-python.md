## python `while` keyword 

1. The`while` keyword is one of the keyword out of thirty-five keywords in python.

2. The `While` condition is true, a series of statements can be run in a while loop, The loop iterates while the condition is true.
When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.

3. In Python, a block of code consists of all the statements that follow a programming construct and are indented by the same number of character spaces. 

## python `while` keyword Uses

In Python, the `while` keyword is used to create a while loop. A while loop is a type of loop that continues to execute until a certain condition is met.

## python `while` keyword Syntax

```python
while condition:
    statements   #indent is compulsory
```

## python `while()` keyword Examples:

let's go through some of examples to understand `while()` keyword in python.

### Example 1: 

If we want to print three numbers after iteration, we'll need to use a while 

```python
i = 0
while i < 4:
  print(i)
  i += 1
```
output:
```python
1
2
3
```
In this example, `i is 0 and less than four`, so only three numbers can result from iteration with the while loop.


### Example 2:

when we want to print the same thing n times 

```python
i=2
while i<5:
        print("pythonshiksha")
        i=i+1
        
```
output:

```python
pythonshiksha
pythonshiksha
pythonshiksha

```
