## complex() function in python:
The `complex()` function is a one of the built-in functions in python.
`complex()` is used for `Returns a complex number`.

The `complex()` function returns a complex number by specifying a real number and an imaginary number.

# Syntax:
```
complex(real, imaginary)
```
where,
real  is Required-  A number representing the real part of the complex number. Default 0. 
The real number can also be a String, like this '3+5j', when this is the case, the second parameter should be omitted.

imaginary is Optional- A number representing the imaginary part of the complex number. Default 0.

# Example:
```
x=complex(4,9) 
print(x) 

```
output:
```
(4+9j)
