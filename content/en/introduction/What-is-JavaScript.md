In simple words, JavaScript adds **interactivity to the webpages.** 

In the programming language world interactivity referes to "the ability of a computer/webpage to respond to a user's input".

If you search on internet you will find plenty of complex definations for JavaScript language. 

But all you need to understand is 

{{< alert theme="info" dir="ltr" >}} 
**JavaScript is a programming language, which enables the communication between the user and the webpages**
{{< /alert >}}


So what kind of communication or interactions we will do with the webpages?

An interaction may be anything like 

1. Entering the data in forms.
2. Validating data before submitting into the server. 
3. Dynamically styling or updating the data in HTML DOM. 
4. Adding animations.
5. User Interactions in Games. 

## JavaScript is platform Independent

JavaScript code runs in the web browser. It does'nt matter in which operating system browser is installed.

It's also called **"client side programming language"** as the code runs in the browser of client machine.

## What are Scripts?

The programs or code written in JavaScript are called as **"Scripts"**.

There are two ways we can write scripts

1. Within the HTML page 
2. Write them in external file with the extension ".js" and refer in HTML page.

## JavaScript is an Interpreted programming language

JavaScript does not need a compiler to run it's code.

The browser read the scripts in the HTML page and runs the code from top to bottom and returns the results.

We dont't have to convert the code into other formats before the browser runs it.
